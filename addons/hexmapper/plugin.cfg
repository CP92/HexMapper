name="HexMapper"
description="Provides a library for working with hexagons and example functionality to generate hexagon maps in different shapes.
At this moment, the plugin portion is a proof of concept \ work in progress. There are some bugs with the plugin panel 
(like needing to have the scene with the HexMapper scene in it be open in the editor in order to configure with the plugin panel).
If you find some and would like to report them, feel free to do so on github: https://github.com/CP92/HexMapper/tree/main 

If you are interested in learning more about haxagon maps I highly recommend checking out https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/ 
as this plugin would not exist without all the hard work done by redblob.

How to:
1. Enable the plugin in the settings.
2. Drag the HexMapper scene into your scene, or use the provided example scene with has a camera and light already set up.
3. Load a mesh in the drop down. You will need to supply your own hexagonal models. I only used .obj file format in testing and it worked great, but I can't confirm if any other formats work. (If you need some tiles to play around with I recommend https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2900)
4. Confirm what the default orientation of the hexagon model is (is it pointy or flat side on the z axis?) and set it under the mesh orientation section.
5. Configure the rest of the plugins to your liking.
6. Run scene and enjoy :)"
